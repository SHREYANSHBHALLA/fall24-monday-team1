## Personalize Your Profile

- As a new user I want to create an account using my email or social media logins so that I can access the gaming journaling features and save my progress.
- As a new user I want to set up my profile with a display name, avatar, and bio so that I can personalize my presence in the application.
- As a gamer I want to link my profiles from gaming platforms (e.g., Steam, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network) so that my achievements and gaming stats can be automatically imported and reflected in my profile.
- As a user I want to customize the privacy settings for my profile and journals so that I can control what information is visible to others.
- As a user I want to view and edit my profile information at any time so that I can keep my profile up-to-date.
- As a gamer I want to view the profiles of other users so that I can see their game progress, journals, and achievements.
- As a user I want to upload a profile photo from my device or select one from a preset gallery so that I can personalize my profile with an image that represents me.
- As a user I want my online status (online/offline) to be visible to others so that my friends or followers can see when I'm active on the app.

## User Journalling

## Game Lists

- As a user, I want to be able to create a list that contains one or more video game titles that I believe share a common thread
- As a user, I want to be able to add a short description that provides more context about the list
- As a user, I want to be able to choose whether to make this list private, accessible only to friends, or visible to anyone on Checkpoint
- As a user, I want to be able to add more games to a list that I own (created by me, or added as a collaborator by another user) in the future
- As a user, I want to be able to add comments to lists as long as I have permission to access this list (if the owner made it public or gave me access to this list)
- As a user, I want to be able to search for lists that other users have created by the name of the list
