## Game Lists

- As a user, I want to be able to create a list that contains one or more video game titles that I believe share a common thread
- As a user, I want to be able to add a short description that provides more context about the list
- As a user, I want to be able to choose whether to make this list private, accessible only to friends, or visible to anyone on Checkpoint
- As a user, I want to be able to add more games to a list that I own (created by me, or added as a collaborator by another user) in the future
- As a user, I want to be able to add comments to lists as long as I have permission to access this list (if the owner made it public or gave me access to this list)
- As a user, I want to be able to search for lists that other users have created by the name of the list
